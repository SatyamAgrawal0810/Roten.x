Project Title:
Mute Voice (Innovative Hand Gesture Translator)

Introduction:
Across the globe, over 70 million people live with speech impairments, often facing exclusion due to communication barriers. Sign language is their primary mode of interaction, yet a vast majority of people do not understand it, leaving them isolated.

Problem Statement:

Speech Impairments: Many individuals rely on text messaging or apps to communicate, or hope that someone nearby understands sign language. This lack of accessibility limits their ability to engage with society fully.

Proposed Solution:
Our device will utilize advanced motion sensors, AI-driven gesture recognition, and speech synthesis technology to bridge the communication gap. Key features include:
Gesture-to-Speech Conversion: The device will capture hand movements and convert them into spoken words, enabling seamless communication for individuals with speech impairments.

Technology Stack:
Sensors & Motion Tracking: Accelerometers, gyroscopes, and flex sensors to detect hand and finger movements.
Machine Learning & AI: Deep learning models trained to recognize gestures and translate them into speech.
Speech Synthesis: A high-quality voice output system to provide clear and natural speech.

Implementation Plan:

Research & Development: Understanding user needs and refining gesture recognition accuracy.

Prototype Development: Building an initial working model for testing.

Testing & User Feedback: Collaborating with individuals who have speech impairments.

Production & Deployment: Scaling the final version for commercial availability.
